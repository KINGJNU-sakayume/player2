# ARC Music v7 — Spotify web player

ARC Music is a restrained personal music archive: the canonical v7 Now Playing, Artist and Album compositions, one
warm paper surface, and short hand-written **notes** — the Editorial Note for artists and albums and the Listening
Note for songs — that open in one shared drawer. Spotify provides authentication, metadata, search and playback.

The playback, library, search, lyrics and translation features of the ARC Catalogue player
([player1](https://github.com/KINGJNU-sakayume/player1)) have been brought over, re-set in the v7 design language
(see [`DESIGN_REVISION_V7_1.md`](DESIGN_REVISION_V7_1.md)). v7.2 ([`DESIGN_REVISION_V7_2.md`](DESIGN_REVISION_V7_2.md))
is built for digging through discographies. Album notes can be long critic-style reviews. Lyrics can carry a curated
translation whose Korean speech level (존댓말 / 반말) is fixed from the song's context before any line is translated.
v7.3 ([`DESIGN_REVISION_V7_3.md`](DESIGN_REVISION_V7_3.md)) adds the discography timeline, previous / next release
navigation and the Archive index. v7.4 ([`DESIGN_REVISION_V7_4.md`](DESIGN_REVISION_V7_4.md)) raises the small type and
the lyric translation line for a 24" desktop monitor. There is still no global playback footer, no Catalogue
or Specimen mode, and transport controls appear only on Now Playing.

| Surface | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Now Playing** | v7 42 / 58 spread. Cover, title, artist · album and Track / Release / Duration / Language on the left; on the right the synced current lyric with its translation and the next two lines, the Listening Note, and the transport — previous / play-pause / next and seek — with shuffle, like, queue, device and volume on one quiet line beneath it. The accent colour follows the album cover. |
| **Artist** | Compact dossier: portrait, name, origin line and Editorial Note. Below it, the **Discography** as a chronology. Albums, Singles & EPs, Compilations and Appears on each load in full, oldest first (or newest first). Releases are grouped by year, with deluxe / remaster / regional editions folded under the original (*+2 editions*), the note's career eras marked in the timeline, and noted releases marked. *Play artist*, *Open in Spotify*. |
| **Album** | Cover, title, artist, release / format / tracks / duration and Editorial Note left; the complete Track Sequence right, with the playing track, guests, explicit marks, discs and a *Note* mark on songs with a song note. *Play album*, *Save album*. Under the sequence, the release's place in the discography (`03 / 12 · Albums`) with the previous and next release — `[` / `]` step through. |
| **Archive** | The index of the archive's own writing: every artist with a note, their reviewed albums in release order, and one entry per song note — marked *Listening note* and / or *Translation · 반말 · 해체* — each opening its note or playing the track. No Spotify request. |
| **Library** | Liked songs (*Shuffle* draws from the whole library, *Play all*), followed artists, liked albums, then playlists and recently played. |
| **Search** | The v7 overlay (`/`): tracks, artists, albums and playlists, type filters with paging, `↓` / `↑` through results. |
| **Queue** | The real Spotify queue in the same right-hand drawer as the notes. |

## Setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 22, a Spotify account (**Premium is required for browser playback and playback control**), a
Spotify Developer application, and a desktop browser with Web Crypto and protected-media (DRM) support.

1. Create an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) with the **Web API**
   and **Web Playback SDK**.
2. Register the exact redirect URI for every environment. Matching is exact (protocol, host, port, path, trailing
   slash). The redirect URI is the app **root**; routes live in the URL hash.
   - Development: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`
   - Production: `https://kingjnu-sakayume.github.io/player2/`

   Spotify does not accept `localhost` in place of `127.0.0.1`.
3. Copy the public Client ID. A client secret is neither needed nor safe in this SPA.
4. While the app is in Development Mode, add every listener under **User Management**.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local   # set VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
npm run dev                  # http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

No Spotify app yet? Choose **Preview without Spotify** (or open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/?preview`).

### Scopes

Declared with the feature that needs each one in [`src/spotify/scopes.ts`](src/spotify/scopes.ts):
`streaming`, `user-read-email`, `user-read-private` (Web Playback SDK); `user-read-playback-state`,
`user-modify-playback-state`, `user-read-currently-playing` (playback, devices, queue); `user-read-recently-played`,
`user-library-read`, `user-follow-read`, `playlist-read-private`, `playlist-read-collaborative` (Library);
`user-library-modify` (Like, Save album). A session authorized before a scope was added keeps working; a quiet line
under the top bar offers **Reconnect Spotify** for the missing features.

### Session

Authorization Code with PKCE (S256 challenge, `state` check, single-use code). Tokens live in `localStorage`
(`arc.spotify.session.v1`) so a reload keeps you signed in; they refresh 60 s before expiry and once after any `401`,
never concurrently (also across tabs). A revoked refresh token shows **Reconnect Spotify**. **Settings → Disconnect**
clears the stored session. Coming from the first v7 build, connect once more: its stored token is discarded and the
library features ask for the new scopes.

## Environment variables

Every `VITE_*` value is public browser code — never put a secret in one.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | — | Spotify app Client ID. Without it the connect screen shows the setup steps and the preview. |
| `VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` | origin + base path | Must equal a registered redirect URI. |
| `VITE_LYRICS_PROVIDER` | `lrclib` | `lrclib`, `mock` or `none`. |
| `VITE_TRANSLATION_PROVIDER` | `browser` | `browser`, `http`, `mock` or `none`. |
| `VITE_TRANSLATION_ENDPOINT` | — | URL of your own translation function (required by `http`). |
| `VITE_TRANSLATION_TARGET` | `ko` | Language lyrics are translated into. |
| `VITE_ENABLE_PREVIEW` | `true` | `false` hides **Preview without Spotify**. |

## Notes (Editorial and Listening)

Notes are ARC's own writing, one Markdown file per note, kept apart from Spotify data:

| Directory | Note | Shown on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`src/editorial/notes/artists/`](src/editorial/notes/artists/) | Artist **Editorial Note** (+ origin line) | Artist |
| [`src/editorial/notes/albums/`](src/editorial/notes/albums/) | Album **Editorial Note**, written as a critic-style review | Album |
| [`src/editorial/notes/songs/`](src/editorial/notes/songs/) | Song **Listening Note**, plus the song's [curated translation](#curated-translations) — one note per song | Now Playing, lyrics header |

Seeded notes: the v7 reference subjects — Vaundy / `strobo` / 怪獣の花唄, Tyler, The Creator / `IGOR` / EARFQUAKE,
tripleS / `<ASSEMBLE24>` / Girls Never Die — and three example artists with representative releases:

- **Kenshi Yonezu** — `STRAY SHEEP`, `LOST CORNER`; Lemon, 感電, KICK BACK
- **tripleS** — `<ASSEMBLE24>`, `ASSEMBLE`; Girls Never Die, Rising
- **Coldplay** — `Parachutes`, `A Rush of Blood to the Head`, `Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends`; Yellow,
  The Scientist, Viva la Vida

The file name is the key. The frontmatter holds the match fields and a `short` preview (2–3 lines; a song cue is
shorter). The body is the long-form note for the drawer. It can use paragraphs, `##` sections, lists, quotes, emphasis
and links. Optional `written` / `updated` dates and `sources` appear at the foot of the drawer. To have Claude
write one, ask for it (*"STRAY SHEEP 리뷰 써줘"*); the procedure and style rules are in
[`.claude/skills/write-note/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/write-note/SKILL.md). Matching, in
[`src/editorial/lookup.ts`](src/editorial/lookup.ts):

1. **Spotify IDs first** — `artistIds`, `albumIds`, `trackIds` (the 22-character part of an `open.spotify.com` link).
   One release usually has several IDs (album cut and single, editions, markets): list the ones you know.
2. **Names as the fallback** — the artist's `names` plus the album or song `titles`, compared case-, width- and
   bracket-insensitively (`<ASSEMBLE24>` = `ASSEMBLE24`). Spotify localises names, so list every form it may show:
   `['Kenshi Yonezu', '米津玄師']`, `['怪獣の花唄', 'Kaiju no Hanauta']`. Albums also check `releaseYear` when both
   years are known.

## …
```

`artist` is the file name of the artist's note. Anything without a file gets no note — never generated filler.
A song note may also carry the song's curated translation: a `translation:` block in the frontmatter, a reserved
`## 번역에 대하여` section at the end of the body and a `<key>.translation.json` next to it
([Curated translations](#curated-translations)). A song with only a translation has a translation-only note (no
`short`, no listening body). `npm run test:run` checks that every file parses, every entry is complete, every album /
song points at an existing artist, and the three parts of each translation come together.

## Lyrics and translation

Spotify's Web API has no lyrics, so both come from replaceable providers and neither ever blocks playback.

- **Lyrics** — [LRCLIB](https://lrclib.net) (`lrclib`): keyless and CORS-enabled; matches title, artist, album and
  duration (or loads the record a song's curated translation was timed on), falls back to a search, and caches results in `localStorage` (30 days; 3 days for "not found"). It sends
  that track metadata to lrclib.net. `mock` gives original test lines; `none` turns lyrics off.
- **Translation** — `browser` uses Chrome's on-device Translator API (no key; a missing model downloads after one
  click in the lyrics header). `http` posts to your own function, which keeps any DeepL / Papago / Google key
  server-side:

  ```text
  POST {VITE_TRANSLATION_ENDPOINT}   { "lines": ["…"], "sourceLanguage": "ja" | null, "targetLanguage": "ko" }
  200                                { "translations": ["…"] }   // same length and order; "" for none
  ```

  Each line's language is detected separately, so only lines not already in the target language are translated.
  **Translation On / Off** sits in the lyrics header and in Settings.

### Curated translations

Machine translation works line by line, so it cannot know who is speaking to whom, and the Korean speech level drifts
from line to line. A **curated translation** decides that first. Its *brief* names the speaker, the addressee, their
relationship, and the speech level kept throughout (하십시오체 / 해요체 / 해체 / 해라체). The whole song is then
translated against the brief, a sentence at a time. It lives with the song's note — one song, one note — and is written
in a Claude session ([`.claude/skills/translate-lyrics/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/translate-lyrics/SKILL.md)):

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| `notes/songs/<key>.md` frontmatter, `translation:` | languages, `register`, speaker → addressee, relationship, situation, pronouns, glossary, dates |
| `notes/songs/<key>.md` body, `## 번역에 대하여` | why this voice, in prose (after the listening note); sources go in the note's `sources` |
| `notes/songs/<key>.translation.json` | `{ "schemaVersion": 2, "timing": { "lrclibId", "durationMs" }, "segments": [{ "startMs", "endMs", "translation" }] }` |

```bash
npm run lyrics:lines -- --title "Lemon" --artist "Kenshi Yonezu" --duration 4:15   # timing + "# startMs endMs text" (terminal only)
npm run lyrics:lines -- --check lemon                                              # segments against the LRCLIB record
```

The repository holds times and translations, never the original lyrics. Segments are time ranges in one LRCLIB record;
at runtime the original lines come from LRCLIB and each segment is placed by time: under the line whose window holds
its start (snapped to the next line within 400 ms), kept — dimmed, not repeated — while later lines of the same
sentence play, and joined with the next segment when LRCLIB puts two sentences on one line. For such a song the app
loads its lyrics straight from that record (`/api/get/<lrclibId>`) instead of searching, so the lyrics and the
translation share one timing; when the playing track is another edit (length off by more than 3 s) it searches as
usual. The translation applies only when the loaded lyrics are that record or one of the same length (±3 s); a note
matched by name rather than track ID also needs Spotify's length within 3 s. Otherwise, and for lines no segment covers, the machine provider translates (a curated
translation also works with `VITE_TRANSLATION_PROVIDER=none`). The lyrics header shows `Curated · 반말 · 해체`;
**Translation note →** opens the song's note at *번역에 대하여* (who speaks to whom, the speech level, pronoun and term
tables, the reasoning). **Translation On / Off** covers curated translations too. A broken translation file is skipped
for that song with a development console warning; `npm run test:run` fails on it. The tool talks to lrclib.net; when
that host is unreachable, `--file` reads a local LRC file kept outside the repository.

The earlier hash-keyed files (`src/translations/`) were converted by `npm run notes:migrate` and removed.

To add a provider, implement `LyricsProvider` ([`src/lyrics/types.ts`](src/lyrics/types.ts)) or
`TranslationProvider` ([`src/translation/TranslationProvider.ts`](src/translation/TranslationProvider.ts)) and
register it in `createLyricsProvider.ts` / `createTranslationProvider.ts` and `src/app/config.ts`. A provider that
needs a secret must sit behind your own backend. No copyrighted lyrics are stored in this repository.

## Preview mode

**Preview without Spotify** (`/?preview`) runs every surface on a sample archive with a simulated clock and no audio:
Kenshi Yonezu, tripleS, Coldplay, Vaundy and Tyler, The Creator with their noted albums. Artist, album and noted-track
IDs are real Spotify IDs, so the preview shows the real notes; track lists and timings are sample data and every lyric
line is an original test line. It never calls Spotify, LRCLIB or a translation service.

## Keyboard

`/` opens search (`↓` / `↑` move, `Enter` opens or plays, `Esc` steps back). On an album, `[` / `]` open the previous / next release in the artist's discography. `Space` plays / pauses when focus is not
on a control. Seek and volume take arrow keys, Page Up / Down, Home and End. The note and queue drawer closes on
`Esc`, traps focus while open and returns it afterwards. `prefers-reduced-motion` removes motion.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # http://127.0.0.1:5173/
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test:run
npm run build
npm run check      # all of the above — run before pushing
npm run lyrics:lines -- …   # curated-translation tool (see Curated translations)
npm run notes:migrate -- --dry-run   # one-time: hash-keyed translations → song notes (already run)
npm run preview    # serve dist/ on http://127.0.0.1:4173/
```

## GitHub Pages deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` runs `npm run check`, builds with the repository base path and deploys `dist/`
on every push to `main`. Set **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** and these repository **Actions variables**:

- `VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://kingjnu-sakayume.github.io/player2/`
- optionally `VITE_LYRICS_PROVIDER`, `VITE_TRANSLATION_PROVIDER`, `VITE_TRANSLATION_ENDPOINT`,
  `VITE_TRANSLATION_TARGET`, `VITE_ENABLE_PREVIEW`

## Architecture

React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, TanStack Query for Spotify data, React Router (`HashRouter`), one global CSS token
layer ([`src/styles/`](src/styles/)) — no UI kit.

```text

```

**One source of truth for playback.** Web Playback SDK events (this browser) or `GET /me/player` polling (another
Spotify Connect device) feed one store with track, position anchor, duration, pause, shuffle, device, volume and
context. The position is never counted by a timer: progress and the lyric cursor derive it from the latest anchor,
so lyrics follow seeks, pauses, device switches and track changes. Commands update the store optimistically and
reconcile with Spotify's next report. The engine handles SDK reconnects, token refresh, Premium / account errors,
autoplay blocking, "no active device", transfer between devices, and browsers that cannot decrypt Spotify audio.

**Colour.** [`src/palette/`](src/palette/) extracts the playing album's dominant colour once, caches it, and adjusts it
until it reaches 3:1 (marks) and 4.5:1 (text) on the warm page — the v7 `--main` accent. Greyscale covers get the ink
accent; surfaces, text and separators always stay neutral.

## Known limitations

- **Premium and browsers.** Browser playback and all playback control need Premium and a desktop browser with DRM
  (Widevine). When the browser cannot decrypt the audio, the engine stops the silent skipping and Now Playing explains
  the fix; otherwise ARC controls another Spotify device as a remote.
- **Development Mode.** Allow-listed users only. Search returns 10 results per type per page. Spotify serves an artist's
  releases 10 at a time, so the discography walks every page of the open group (one request per 10 releases, cached
  for 30 minutes, capped at 300). An artist with many singles takes a moment the first time. Followers and genres may
  be missing and are never required.
- **Queue** is read-only (the Web API cannot reorder it). Episodes, ads and local files show the idle state.
- **Playlists** play as a context; there is no playlist page.
- **Autoplay.** The first play in a session may need one click or key press.
- **Lyrics** coverage and timing on LRCLIB vary; translation is machine translation (desktop Chrome for `browser`).
- **Cover colour** falls back to the v7 red when a cover cannot be read.

## Troubleshooting

- **State mismatch / missing verifier:** start Connect Spotify again in the same tab; do not reuse an old callback URL.
- **`INVALID_CLIENT` / redirect mismatch:** register the root URI above exactly and use the same value in
  `VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`.
- **Playback forbidden:** check Premium and that the account is allow-listed in Development Mode.
- **Device not ready:** keep the tab open, allow protected content, then **Settings → Use browser device** or pick a
  device from the device menu on Now Playing.
- **Tracks skip without playing:** update Widevine (`chrome://components`), allow protected content, disable blocking
  extensions for the site — or open the Spotify app, choose it in the device menu and use ARC as a remote.
- **429:** wait for the displayed interval; the client already backs off.
